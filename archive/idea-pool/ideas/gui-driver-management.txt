===== Description =====
/* Describe your idea here. */
The point here, is that although openSUSE has a great tool named YaST, user still has to solve some problems from console or 3rd party apps. I'll provide an example of my own. I have a Dell Inspiron 1525 laptop. Ubuntu 8.04.1 could manage all of my hardware either out-of-box or through Restricted Drivers Manager (project jockey). openSUSE couldn't configure my Broadcom 4310 wi-fi card. The official solution is to run a bash script to download a firmware. That, however, didn't work out for me. So I had to use Ndiswapper, which still couldn't be managed from within YaST. And I believe, that Broadcom issue is not the only one. So, either YaST should get extended to deal with such things (and I believe it's a better solution) or another tool should be offered - but still, all hardware issues should be able to deal with in GUI. It should also download the needed drivers from repos (or install it from installation media) when the drivers are not included by default.

Probably a solution for it also involves another thing. Each time a user installs openSUSE on his box, all info concerning hardware on the machine should be uploaded to a centralized online database - like it happens in Ubuntu, Fedora (with smolt) or Mandriva (with HCL). There each entry that isn't supported out-of-box should get a script that would download necessary files and write necessary config lines to make that piece of hardware running. And then, YaST should query this database, get this script and run it.

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
