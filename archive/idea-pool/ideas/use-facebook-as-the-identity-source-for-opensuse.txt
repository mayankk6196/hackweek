===== Description =====
/* Describe your idea here. */
In my opinion, creating a new user identity to become a registered user on openSUSE is a barrier.  Besides the fact I'm tired of maintaining what seems like a bazillion internet identities.  Facebook is fast becoming the largest social network site on the Internet and best of all they support an open application development platform.  It would be relatively easy for openSUSE to leverage identities from Facebook rather than maintaining it's own identity store. With over 40 million current users and growing at 3% a month many new potential openSUSE community members will already have a Facebook identity which will aid in quickly provisioning the user.

Brady Anderson originated this idea.  No one is currently working on implementing this idea (it's up for grabs!).

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
HW-PM: You want help from a product manager, to get market research or talk to a partner.
HW-Docs: You want someone to help you write documentation for your project.
HW-Packaging: Your project is going well but you want someone to help you build packages out of it.
