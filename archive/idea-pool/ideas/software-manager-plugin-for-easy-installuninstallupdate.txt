===== Description =====
/* Describe your idea here. */
To put this very simple: the openSUSE version of the CNR plugin, but working with the openSUSE software portal!

The idea is to create a CNR-like Plugin where people could simply choose what they want to Install. But specially (since "1 click install" is already available) what they want to Uninstall or Update/Upgrade without having to know anything about libraries, repos, dependencies or anything else.

Want to uninstall - Just select the program you want to uninstall, click uninstall and it's done!  The plugin would do all the cleanings for you (such as, for example, when i uninstall a software I do not want his repos to be installed anymore - the plugin should erase them).

Same thing to Update/Upgrade and to Installation.

It would be good if this was integrated with the software available in the software portal and also get notifications on new updates to software.

Why? Well, everytime i talk about how good Linux is, everyone seems to like a lot about what they're earing but when i get to the part concerning software Instalation/Uninstalation/Update... well... they all quickly quite the change from Windows to Linux. Software is the window to the world... This has to be made easy to hit the masses - that most don't know much about computers OS.

/* How to Use Tags

All idea pages are tagged to make them easier to find and to indicate to the rest of the world the current state of your project.

You can apply as many topic and product tags to your idea as you want.

Status Tags
-----------
Idea: No one is working on this idea yet.
InProgress:  The project is underway.  When you apply this tag to an idea, please also edit the People section of the page to indicate who is working on the project. 
TryMe:  This project is at the point where other people can try it.  Include a link for code/packages in the page so people can find it.
InBuildService:  Idea's implementation posted in the openSUSE build service.  Provide a link.
Done:  The idea has been fully realized (though it may not yet be in a product).
Shipped:  Hooray!

Help tags:  
----------

You can apply Help tags to your project to recruit other people to help you with its implementation.  Don't apply Help tags to a project which is not already being implemented.  
Before applying any HelpWanted tags to your project, make sure that you've listed the current project contributors and leaders in the People section of this page, so that potential contributors know whom to contact.

HelpWanted:  This is a generic tag that you can apply to indicate that you want help on a project.
HW-Hacker: You need help writing code.
HW-Tester: You have something that you want help testing, or writing unit tests for.
HW-Designer: You have a great idea but can't come up with the UI? Ask for help.
